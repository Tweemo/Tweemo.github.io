    <h1>Hello World! My name is Tim Liew!</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to my blog where I will post all my progress and struggles in foundation. But first a little intro.</h2>

    <p> 
      I'm a student web developer at Dev Academy currently living in Wellington, New Zealand.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>
      I was born and raised in Wellington and therefore have suffered horrendous allergies ever since. 
      Since a young age, I have always been interested in games and all things relating to games, including programming. 
      Though I never saw programming as a career that I could get into as it seemed like it was too difficult. 
      Fast forward a little, I studied at the Univeristy of Otago and received my Bachelor of Pharmacy with distinction (woo woo) and had been working in a pharmacy ever since. 
      Working in that environment in general and through COVID made me realise how much I really don't want to be in that industry. 
      Now I hear some of my friends are taking this course of Dev Academy and they're loving it, So I ask about it. 
      From then on, I decided that this is a good opportunity to make a major career shift to something that I will most likely enjoy because in a sense it is like an extension of one of my biggest hobbies. 
    </p>

    <h3>Aspirations</h3>
    <p>
      At this stage I want to be a full stack developer. 
      But in the future it would be nice to learn and become proficient in different techonologies.
