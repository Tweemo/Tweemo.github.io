        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Wellington and therefore have suffered horrendous allergies ever since. 
          Since a young age, I have always been interested in games and all things relating to games, including programming. 
          Though I never saw programming as a career that I could get into as it seemed like it was too difficult. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Fast forward a little, I studied at the University of Otago and received my Bachelor of Pharmacy with distinction (woo woo) and had been working in a pharmacy ever since. 
          Working in that environment in general and through COVID made me realise how much I really don't want to be in that industry. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Now I hear some of my friends are taking this course of Dev Academy and they're loving it, so I ask about it. 
          From then on, I decided that this is a good opportunity to make a major career shift to something that I will most likely enjoy because in a sense it is like an extension of one of my biggest hobbies. 
        </p>

        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
          At this stage I want to be a full stack developer. 
          But in the future it would be nice to learn and become proficient in different techonologies.
