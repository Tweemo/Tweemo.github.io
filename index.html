    <h1 class="title">Hello World! My name is Tim Liew!</h1>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Welcome to my blog where I will post all my progress and struggles in foundation. But first a little intro.</h2>

    <p class="tiny-intro">
      I'm a student web developer at Dev Academy currently living in Wellington, New Zealand.

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Wellington and therefore have suffered horrendous allergies ever since. 
          Since a young age, I have always been interested in games and all things relating to games, including programming. 
          Though I never saw programming as a career that I could get into as it seemed like it was too difficult. 
          Fast forward a little, I studied at the Univeristy of Otago and received my Bachelor of Pharmacy with distinction (woo woo) and had been working in a pharmacy ever since. 
          Working in that environment in general and through COVID made me realise how much I really don't want to be in that industry. 
          Now I hear some of my friends are taking this course of Dev Academy and they're loving it, So I ask about it. 
          From then on, I decided that this is a good opportunity to make a major career shift to something that I will most likely enjoy because in a sense it is like an extension of one of my biggest hobbies. 
        </p>

        <h3>Aspirations</h3>
        <p>
          At this stage I want to be a full stack developer. 
          But in the future it would be nice to learn and become proficient in different techonologies.
