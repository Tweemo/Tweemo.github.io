        <h3>Website Basics</h3>
    
        <p>
            A Basic website will contain 3 main components, these components are HTML, CSS and Javascript or JS for short. 
            <br><br>
            HTML is the content that will be on the page, so all the headers, sentences and pictures. 
            <br>
            CSS is how that content is styled, so CSS works to make things look pretty and adjust the spacings between all the content on the page. 
            <br>
            JS is used to create interactive elements, which means anything interactive would have been built with javascript. 
            <br><br>
            An example: A button that generates a random number each time it is pressed. 
            <br><br>
            HTML: Will be the button and the name of the button. 
            <br>
            CSS: How the button looks and where it is positioned. 
            <br>
            JS: The function that causes the button to generate a random number when clicked. 
        </p>
    
        <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
            A way to visualise the difference HTML and CSS would be to compare them to a skeleton and skin, respectively. 
            HTML is the structure that keeps things together and CSS is what is added on top to make it look more appealing.         </p>
    
        <h3>Control Flow</h3>
        <p>
            Control flow is essentially the order in which functions and statements will be run. 
            The control flow for Javascript is top down, so the code will run starting from the top. 
            <br><br>
            This also means functions can not use variables that have not been defined before it. 
            Which essentially means if you want to use a variable in a function, you should define it before the function so that it exists in the control flow. 
            Otherwise, you will try execute a function that uses something that doesn’t exist yet. 
            <br><br>
            An example of control flow would be like shooting a basketball, the main actions or functions you need would be ‘get basketball’, ‘move ball into shooting position’, ‘bend legs’, ‘jump’, then ‘release the ball’. 
            Now the order I mentioned them in would be how I would order it in javascript starting with ‘get basketball’ at the top and so on. 
        </p>

        <h3>Loopy Loops</h3>
        <p>
            Loops are a function/bit of code that you can use to run the same code over and over with a different value. 
            <br><br>
            An example of a real life loop would be returning from a grocery shop and putting each item back in the cupboard or fridge. 
            You ‘loop’ through the contents of the bag and for each item you would want to assign them to the ‘cupboard’ or ‘fridge’.   
        </p>
        <h3>What is the DOM and how to interact with it</h3>
        <p>
            The DOM or Document Object Model is essentially like a tree structure of all the contents on a web page. 
            Starting from the top being the document itself, then ‘branching’ off into small components until you get into the HTML content. 
            <br><br>
            <img src="INSERT IMAGE OF DOM TREE">
            <br><br>
            Some ways you might interact with the DOM would be to breakdown elements of a webpage to see how it is structured. 
            You can also use the DOM to edit your own code so that you don’t have to save your code and reload the page. 
            Once you are happy with some changes you can then just use the code from the DOM and paste it into your code. 
        </p>

        <h3>The difference in accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
        <p>
            Accessing data in an array is like accessing data in a list that contains multiple values. 
            <br>
            E.g [cats, dogs, fish] each value in this array has an assigned number. 
            <br>
            Arrays start counting from 0, therefore, cats would be assigned [0], dogs [1] and fish [2].
            <br><br>
            In contrast, objects has properties, which is like a feature of the object. 
            <br>
            E.g object = car, has the properties, model, colour, brand, age. 
            <br>
            To access these properties you would put the object name, a period and then the property you want to access. 
            If I wanted to get the car colour, I would write car.colour in javascript. 
        </p>

        <h3>What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
        <p>
            Functions are a block of code designed to carryout a particular task, they are actioned when they are ‘called’ by something. 
            Functions are useful when you want to push some values through code. 
            <br><br>
            For example; if you wanted the function to do some maths for you. 
            You could make a function that divides two values and all you would need to do is input the values that you want to divide. 
            There are endless uses for functions.
