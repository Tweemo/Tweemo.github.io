        <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I learned that I had an ego and thought it would be easy to learn a new skillset and was spectacularly humbled by everything.</li>
                    <li>I learned to better fend off the negative voices telling me that this is too hard</li>
                    <li>I learned that having a break more times than not is much better than continually bashing my head against the problem.</li>
                </ol>>
            </p>


        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>
                Values can determine how you approach a problem, everybody will value something different which means the basis of which they apply themselves to find a solution will be different. 
                <br><br>
                Empathy allows you to put yourself into the perspective of people that you work with. 
                This ability allows for greater teamwork because if you can understand someones feelings you can potentially help them get out of a rut which will greatly improve the teams morale.
                <br><br>
                Self-awareness is being aware of your own personal strengths, weaknesses and abilities. 
                If everybody on your team is self-aware then it allows everyone to work together smoothly and efficiently.
            </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest thing that surprised me was that initially I had thought that I had a growth mindset but then as I got into the more difficult parts of challenges.
                My mindset quickly changed and the voices would be telling me that it's too hard. 
            </p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            The most challenging part was probably the cultural values because I had not really dug too deep in to that prior, so it was a bit difficult to piece together how everything was connected. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think we spend so much time on it because in the workforce there are a lot of people that have the same skills or those skills can be easily learned on the job. 
            This means the main thing that sets different candidates apart is their personal/soft skills. 
            If we develop these skills more so than other candidates than we become a lot more attractive to employers. 
            This is because what really makes a team work well is good overall soft skills which helps boost team morale and helps others in the team when in need.  
        </p>


        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answers</h2>
        <p>
            I donâ€™t think it was a waste of time because I enjoyed delving into those aspects of my own life. 
            It also gave us a break from practicing programming providing like a mental rest. 
            I think if we focussed on just smashing out a lot of practice we would get good but we would also become burnt out quite quickly.
