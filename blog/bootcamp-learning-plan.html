        <h2>Long Term Goal/s</h2> 

    <p>
        My long term goal is to become a full stack web developer and work in the finance or gaming industry.
        I would like to be able to help people carry tasks that are normally troublesome and fiddly.
        At the moment I do not have a destination in mind. 
        I'm willing to try my hand other industries because there could be a role that I really enjoy but have not currently thought about.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths:</h2>

    <p>
        Foundations:
        <br>
        My strengths are that I can adapt to changes in situations quickly and effectively which means as soon as any changes/issues arise, it is not difficult for me to change the plan where necessary. 
        Another strength would be my resilience, which means that even if I run into difficulties during a task I will push through and continue. 
        More often than not, bumps in the road will only cause a change in approach to accomodate. 
        <br><br>

        Bootcamp:
        <br>
        My strengths are very much the same with the exception of my resilience which I have found is not as strong as I had initially thought.
        This doesn't mean I don't have any resilience, it's more that I find myself beaten down after tough challenges. 
        After giving the challenge a break, I tend to bounce back and figure out how to solve the challenge. 
        I have discovered that I will try lots of different approaches to a problem even if there's a chance that it could break my code. 
        This may help me in bootcamp to reduce the fear of messing up code and to drive the fact that code is not always correct the first time. 
    </p>


    <h2>Weaknesses: </h2>

    <p>
        Foundations:
        <br>
        A limitation would be that I find it hard to get in the zone to start a task. 
        This means that I can find myself procrastinating a lot when I struggle to get the ball rolling. 
        Another limitation, tied to my resilience is that I can find that there are times where I pursue tasks for longer than I should. 
        I find that there are many times where I find myself down a rabbit hole because I keep finding interesting things to learn. 
        <br><br>

        Bootcamp:
        <br>
        I have found during foundations that I have been able to get the ball rolling a lot faster than I had originally expected.
        This will help me in bootcamp to persevere through all of the challenges. 
        I still find myself trying to pursue tasks longer than I should which will hinder me during bootcamp since we will be going through a lot of content quickly.
        I will be mindful of this as we go through bootcamp to not get bogged down in a rabbit hole. 
    </p>


    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

    <p>
        I think the biggest non-technical challenges for me would be trying to stay on top of material and keeping focussed for 9 weeks. 
        This is because there have been many times where I have gotten behind and find it difficult to get back up to speed. 
        Although, I have found it easier to get into the zone, I have a feeling that trying to keep it up for 9 weeks may be taxing.
        But, if I can keep it up for 9 weeks it will definitely help my mental and reinforce the idea of a growth mindset.
    </p>


    <h2>What non-technical/human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

    <p>
        I would like to develop my leadership skills and my ability to work in larger groups.
        This is because I have had limited experience in working with large groups. 
    </p>



    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>

    <p> 
        I expect the facilitation team to be an easily accessible channel of information and help when required. 
        Though, I do understand that this help will not be instant as there are other peers. I expect clear communication between me and the facilitation team. 
    </p>

    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>

    <p>
        I expect myself to reach out for help in a timely manner because bootcamp is an entirely different beast.
        I will manage my workload appropriately and make sure that when I am working that I minimise any potential distractions from my own workflow.
        I will work safely with others by keeping open channels for conversation and checking in with my teammates to see how they are going. 
        Teammates will include facilitators and industry/community representatives and I will work to maintain good relationships with everyone involved.
