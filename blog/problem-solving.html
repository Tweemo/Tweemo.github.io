        <h2>A Time When I got Blocked by a Simple Problem</h2>
            <p>
                When I was working on the first built-in methods challenge, I needed to research about join arrays into a string.
                During this research I had read that the when I used <code class="code"> .join </code> it would return as a string. 
                For some reason I thought okay this means if I just input <code class="code">arr.join(' ')</code> it will return the string automatically.
                <br><br>
                Oh, was I wrong... So I spent a little more time googling and looking through the worked exampled to figure out what I did wrong. 
                They had something in common that I didn't have. 
                They all had <code class="code"> return arr.join(' ') </code>, it was at this point I realised, I need to read my code and think, does this make sense?
                I felt pretty stupid after that, but it's alright, I will never forget it now. 
                I learned that sometimes, instead of diving straight in and constantly changing code I slowly go through my code and makes sense.
                Because there will be times where something small will just break your code. 
            </p>


        <h2>That Time I Solved a Problem Elegantly</h2>
            <p>
                During a different portion of the built-in methods challenge. 
                We needed to write some code to remove the words 'buzz' from an incoming string and return a string. 
                The way I overcame this problem was by using <code class="code">console.log()</code> extensively. 
                After each method I used on the string, I console logged it to see what I got and in what format. 
                <br><br>
                This allowed me to know which methods to use on the current string/array to get the correct answer. 
                I felt pretty good throughout this process because it felt like I was putting my learning to work. 
                I learned that I need to take things one small step at a time rather than try to solve the problem all in one go.
            </p>

        <h2>How Confident I Am Using Problem Solving Processes</h2>
            <p>
                <img class="solving-list" src="../images/problem-solving-list.png" alt="list of problem solving processes">
            </p>

            <p>
                Out of these problem solving processes, I am somewhat confident with trying something, reading error messages, console.logging, and asking peers and coaches for help.
                Though I do find that I still try to solve the problem for a long time before I ask for assistance. 
                There are times when I am googling solutions and I find that some solutions are a bit complicated or I don't know how to apply the examples correctly. 
                <br><br>
                I am trying to use pseudocode more and more often, but I find the pseudocode I write doesn't help that much. 
                But I will continue to write it so that I can be become at it. 
                I don't find myself using the rubber ducky method too often, but I still use it at times. 
                Though I am not confident with using it as I find it doesn't help as much as the other methods mentioned. 
                <br><br>
                Finally, I have been reflecting a lot on how I carry out the challenges but I have not been improving my process as much as I should be. 
                This is a work in progress and I will try to improve my process as I go along.
