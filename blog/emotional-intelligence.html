    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

    <p>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to be able to perceive, control and evaluate emotions. 
        What this means is being able to understand the emotions that you go through day to day but also being able to understand the emotions of people you interact with. 
        This ability allows to become more rational in your actions without them being necessarily emotion driven. 
        <br><br>
        Having high emotional intelligence would indicate a good ability to manage your own emotions and not pushing them under the rug for them to come back out later. 
        It means to be able to manage them head on and move on so that your body does not become taxed from having to push away emotions. 
    </p>

    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
        IQ is your ability to solve problems and grasp complex ideas. IQ mainly measures your logical thinking and how you can apply and communicate those complex ideas. 
        <br><br>
        The difference would be that IQ would be how you can apply logic to a scenario but EQ would be how you can perceive and manage the emotions of yourself and others that can affect that logical thinking. 
        <br><br>
        The combination of EQ and IQ would form the majority of ‘intelligence’. 
        Having an imbalance of EQ/IQ can negatively affect job performances, relationships and overall well-being. 
        <br><br>
        An example would be if somebody had high IQ but low EQ. 
        This person would be able to apply a high-level of logical thinking in their problem solving. 
        However, because of the lack of EQ they would lack the ability to perceive and manage their emotions of themselves or those around them. 
        This could lead to emotionally-driven decisions and deteriorate their relationships which could then spiral into a poor sense of well-being. 
        Those with low EQ may have issues with emotional outbursts, poor coping mechanisms and blaming others for they misfortunes. 
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    <p>
        EQ is important because it helps us maintain good relationships (working and personal), reduce conflict and reduce team stress. 
        Having a workplace full of people with high EQ means that if there is any conflict, they have the ability to take a break, manage those emotions then come back and discuss the issue. 
        The ability to think of even having a break in a conflict shows high EQ because they do not let their emotions in that moment take over. 
        More times than not when people come back after that break they will feel more calm and in a better mindset to confront the conflict. 
        <br><br>
        This type of ability would help reduce team stress and increase productivity as a whole because any issues are being discussed and confronted. 
        Compared to people insulting each other in the heat of the moment which then leads to team members to hold resentment for each other. 
        This can create a tense atmosphere which is not an ideal work environment. 
        This can be applied to personal lives as well, conflicts are not restricted to work but also family affairs.
