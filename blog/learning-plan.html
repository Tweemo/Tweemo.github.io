        <h2>Long Term Goal/s</h2> 

    <p>My long term goal is to become a full stack web developer and to also branch into game development. </p>

    <h2>Strengths:</h2>

    <p>My strengths are that I can adapt to changes in situations quickly and effectively which means as soon as any changes/issues arise, it is not difficult for me to change the plan where necessary. 
        Another strength would be my resilience, which means that even if I run into difficulties during a task I will push through and continue. 
        More often than not, bumps in the road will only cause a change in approach to accomodate. </p>

    <h2>Weaknesses: </h2>

    <p>
        A limitation would be that I find it hard to get in the zone to start a task. 
        This means that I can find myself procrastinating a lot when I struggle to get the ball rolling. 
        Another limitation, tied to my resilience is that I can find that there are times where I pursue tasks for longer than I should. 
        I find that there are many times where I find myself down a rabbit hole because I keep finding interesting things to learn. 
    </p>


    <h2>How I will manage my workload</h2>

    <p>
        I will manage my workload to make sure that I am putting enough efficient hours each day and trying to stay ahead where possible so that I am on top of things. 
        I will achieve this by working collaboratively with other learners and facilitators so that nobody is left behind and to form a cohesive cohort. 
        Ensuring that there is an easy, un-obstructed channel where everyone can communicate freely would be the easiest way to allow to productive discussions.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will speak to my facilitators and other learners and ask for help where I can. 
        Also, having a small break when things are getting to me can be a good way to have a small mental reset. 
        It will also be advantageous to talk about the struggles with my peers. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I will seek help by speaking to my peers and facilitators in a timely manner so that I do not spend too much time on my own delving into problems.
    </p>

    <p> 
        I expect the facilitation team to be an easily accessible channel of information and help when required. 
        Though, I do understand that this help will not be instant as there are other peers. I expect clear communication between me and the facilitation team. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I need to make sure that if I do have any other commitments that I factor them in to the amount of time I can spend learning. 
        It is also important that if I do have any commitments that take up a substantial amount of time that I do try get ahead in the learning. 
        This is to ensure I do not fall behind when I return. 
    </p>

    <h2>A Skill I Wish to Develop at Dev Academy</h2>

    <p>
        While I am at Dev Academy I would like to develop my leadership skills as it is something that I have been wanting to work on for a while now. 
        At this stage I do not feel like I have the confidence to become a good leader, though I hope during my time here, that will change even a little.
