    <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
        <p>
        When I was working as a pharmacist intern, there was a situation when someone had brought it a hand written prescription for tramadol, which is a pain killer that can be abused. 
        The prescription was self prescribed, which meant the doctor had written the prescription for themselves. 
        Immediately, red flags had begun to ring so I checked the medical council to firstly check if they were actually registered and practicing
        They were, so my next step was to call the doctor to find out what it was going on. 
        <br><br>
        It turns out that they had been having immense back pain which made it difficult for them to get up. Though, it is not illegal for them to prescribe medications for themselves, it does pose an ethical issue. 
        This is because it is not best practice for medical professionals to prescribe medicines for themselves based on what they think they have but rather have another professional assess the situation and provide care accordingly. 
        While on the phone with the patient I asked them if it was possible if another doctor could assess their situation and for them to send a prescription through. 
        They had no issue with this and did see a doctor, which led to a new prescription to be sent through. 
        <br><br>
        What I was weighing up was being able to help the patient with her pain or sticking to my principles and making sure another doctor is involved. 
        As much as I wanted to help the patient, I did not know her and it is hard to know peoples intentions when you have only spoken to them on the phone. 
        By involving another doctor there is another medical professional that has seen and assessed this persons condition. 
        The consequences of this action were that the patient was in pain for a longer duration. 
        <br><br>
        In the end, the doctor did receive the care that they needed and were understanding of my position. 
        </p>
    
    <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up in my Chinese household has influenced how I act by being taught to always help out people where you can. 
            What I mean by help does not always mean big gestures, it can just be small things. 
            <br><br>
            For example: This happened the other day, but I overheard someone looking for a type of food at the market and they seemed to be having issues finding it. 
            So, while I was shopping, I was keeping an eye for it too. I ended up finding where it was and I happened to be in the same isle, so I let them know where it is. 
            The main things I keep in mind are that if you do help someone, you do not do it to expect anything back and that small gestures can help someone have an easier day. 
            <br><br>
            While I do value being able to help people where I can, I would not do it if I needed to compromise myself in any major way. 
            As I got older, the culture around my family had changed, at the current stage it is just about being happy and doing things that make you happy. 
            I believe now that striving for happiness is one of the traits that is apart of my identity.

    <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>

    <p>
    My strengths are that I can adapt to changes in my environment and work space very well to work effectively. 
    This helps with my problem solving ability as I can adapt to any issues or changes in a system fairly quickly. 
    <br><br>
    Limitations to my learning and career development are that I often find it hard to get the ball rolling. 
    This has led me to procrastinating when I know there are tasks to be done. 
    However, once the ball does the rolling, I can find myself in the zone fairly quickly.
    <br><br> 
    One of my other strengths is that I never expect anything that I produce to be perfect on the first time. 
    The way I learn is by tackling a problem with all the skills that I have available, then going through it again more thoroughly and picking up parts that did not go well and working on it. 
    </p>

<h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
    <p>
        My mindset of knowing that nothing will be perfect after the first try will be my greatest asset, as it means I can go through a task and do all the parts I can do quickly. 
        Then, I will go back to the areas where I had struggled and spend more time learning and developing my skills. 
       <br><br>
        By doing the work that I already know how to do first then going back to more difficult work means I can maximise my time in trying to learn new skills while also polishing old ones.
    </p>
    
    <h2> 
        Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
        Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
    </h2>
    <p>
        During my final year at university, we needed to write a group research paper. 
        As a group we decided to split up the work evenly and set a time that we would all have it done by. 
        <br><br>
        Two out of Six of the group did not do any sufficient work because they essentially plagiarised what they found. 
        I do not know if it was resistance or reluctance to do work but after the first meeting they did not come to any more meetings. 
        From that point on, their contribution was non-existent.
        <br><br>
        There were two others in the group that did help with the work initially, but as time passed we noticed less and less contribution.
        Ultimately, it was up to me and the last group member to essentially write and proof read the research paper.
        <br><br>
        The strategies we tried to use was giving them small tasks to do first so that it would be easy for them to do. 
        We also tried to plan meetings well in advance so that they would know so that we could try get them to come without any hiccups. 
        Neither of these strategies worked well at all because there was still minimal to no work done. 
        <br><br>
        Looking back now it could have come off as looking down on them by giving them small tasks to do. 
        Strategies I would use now would be to pull them aside and talk to them individually away from the group setting to see their perspective. 
        Once I know their intentions then we can try solve any issues and accomodate so that everybody can work well together. 
        This strategy means that the issue is solved without having to potentially belittle anybody and without saying anything in front of the group.

        There were times where our supervisor would address us through email as timothy et al.
