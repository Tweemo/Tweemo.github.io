<h2>Research neuroplasticity</h2>
    

<h3>How does understanding principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
        <p>
            The benefits are that once you understand those principles, it opens up the idea that regardless of your habits and experiences, there is a way change. 
            In this context it means that even if you have worked in an area for a long time and don’t think that you are able to learn a completely new skillset for a new job. 
            You can, because you can shape your brain differently. 
        </p>
    <h3>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
    <p>
        Engaging with these principles allows me to have the idea that learning new concepts about a completely different field that I’m used to is possible.
    </p>

    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
            Some ways that would help increase my neuroplasticity would be to get into the correct mindset. 
            Now that I am aware and am applying these principles, I need to get into a mindset where I believe that I can learn a whole new skillset. 
            It may not be as quick as I may think, but it is possible and it will improve the learning in any capacity in the long run.
        </p>


<h2>Research growth mindset</h2>

    <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
    <p>
        A growth mindset is believing that you can learn anything and increase your intelligence. 
        It is relevant because having this mindset does not allow for restrictions to be placed on yourself about what you can and can’t learn. 
        The opposite, a fixed mindset is the thought that you will either get something or you’re not born to, this is damaging as it affects how people can learn and improve in all capacities. 
    </p>

    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>
        After reading into this, nothing has changed, I have always tried to get myself into a growth mindset as I think that anything can learned as long as the person applies themselves and maintains a positive mindset towards achieving their goal. 
    </p>

    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey</h3>
    <p>
        I will remind myself anytime that I get stuck in any problem and that I may not understand it now, but eventually with practice I will get better. 
    </p>

        I found this article on <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/change-is-a-choice-nurturing-neuroplasticity-in-your-life-0930154">Good Therapy</a> to be quite insightful and covers both neuroplasticity and growth mindset and goes over how they are related. 
    </p>

    <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding these concepts influences my learning plan and strategy by providing insight that there is a possibility of learning a completely new skillset and changing my career. 
        It’s about having the mindset to be able to do these things but also creating an environment where your brain can thrive and build connections effectively. 
        <br><br>
        The article referenced mentions that doing physical activity can improve neuroplasticity as physical activity can increase the oxygen and blood flow to the brain. 
        This means that I should incorporate actions into my learning plan that can provide my brain with everything that it needs to become more malleable and to facilitate a growth mindset.
